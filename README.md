# My Portfolio Assignment


The purpose of this project was to practice some of the responsive web design systems we have learned, as well as implementing some of the bootstrap frameworks and at the same time creating a portfolio for ourselves.

## Building the site

### About Me Page

I created the About Me Page, then using bootstrap I created things like the Nav bar, and inserted it on this and every page. Then using bootstrap I got to work laying out the page, placing the images and links and text where it needed to be using the grid system. Then when that was all inserted, I worked on the colour scheme and started writing up the content for the page. I tweaked the bootstrap as needed, and created my own CSS style sheet to make all of the final touches.

### Portfolio Page

This one was quite simple, using the framework from the main page, I placed some placeholder images, as my portfolio right now is very limited, I hope to add more to this as I go. With Bootstrap, the images are responsive and so it took very little tweaking to get everything to work.

### Contact

For this page I made a form with all of the inserts for people to be able to contact me. As it stands it doesnt do anything but I will update this as I learn to make it functional

## Usage

This will be eventually used as my portfolio page to show the world. It is very basic as it stands, and not all of it is functional, but as I learn it will get better and that will be a good show of how I have improved as this course goes on.

## Closing

This was a great learning experience for responsive web design, and getting everything to look good on all sized devices without a lot of headache. It will be good to see it when it is complete and be able to go back and see how it evolved.
